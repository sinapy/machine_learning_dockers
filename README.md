# machine_learning_dockers

Docker can be very beautiful. I use the visual studio code's Docker extension and a tensorflow's docker image to set up tensorflow with gpu capability and code like the environment is on my machine.

In this repository, I add a docker image for any machine learning / NLP / Recommendation system environments that are hard to get right.
